# Embedded Traffic Signals System 🚦

This is a simple embedded systems project that simulates a traffic light controller using Embedded C and Proteus.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Embedded C
- Proteus 8 (ISIS)
- Microcontroller (e.g., PIC or ATmega)

## 📋 Project Description
The system simulates the behavior of traffic signals (Red, Yellow, Green) with proper timing logic. It's designed to help beginners understand basic embedded systems, LED control, and timing-based automation using microcontrollers.

## 🔧 Features
- Traffic light logic with real-time delays
- LED control using microcontroller pins
- Simulation circuit built in Proteus

## 📂 Files
- `.c` file: Contains the source code in Embedded C
- `.dsn` file: Proteus simulation circuit

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `.dsn` file in Proteus
2. Make sure the code is compiled and uploaded to the microcontroller (if applicable)
3. Run the simulation and observe the traffic light sequence
